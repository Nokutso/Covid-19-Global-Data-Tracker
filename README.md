# Covid-19 Global Data Tracker
## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to explore COVID-19 trends in selected countries, focusing on total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

--- 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Below, we examine total cases and deaths over time to observe major trends and spikes.

### Total Cases Over Time

The line chart above illustrates how COVID-19 cases increased over time in the selected countries.

- **India** experienced a sharp rise during the mid-2021 period, likely due to the Delta variant surge.
- **The United States** had multiple waves, with the highest spike occurring in early 2022.
- **Kenya** showed a more gradual increase, with smaller peaks, possibly due to lower testing/reporting or population size.

This visualization helps us see the general spread trend and magnitude of the outbreak in each country.

### Total Deaths Over Time

This chart shows the total number of reported COVID-19 deaths.

- **The USA** has the highest death count, reflecting both high case numbers and population size.
- **India** shows a steep incline in deaths during the same period as its case surge.
- **Kenya** maintains a significantly lower death count, though this might reflect underreporting or limited testing.

Analyzing deaths alongside cases provides context for how severely the pandemic affected each country.

### Daily New COVID-19 Cases

This line chart displays the number of new COVID-19 cases reported daily in each country.

- **India** had significant daily spikes, especially during its second wave, showing how rapidly the virus spread.
- **The USA** shows frequent surges, reflecting multiple pandemic waves.
- **Kenya** experienced lower and more stable daily cases, but this may reflect testing capacity rather than actual case numbers.

These spikes are crucial for understanding pandemic pressure on health systems and for tracking how effective interventions like lockdowns and vaccinations were.

## Key Insights
1. India has the highest total number of COVID-19 cases among the selected countries.
2. The United States showed a sharp increase in new daily cases in late 2021.
3. Congo had one of the slowest vaccine rollouts, with less than 20% of its population vaccinated as of the latest data.
4. There is a strong correlation between population size and total cases.
5. Despite having a lower case count, Congo had a relatively high death rate early in the pandemic.

## Anomalies or Interesting Patterns
- Some countries show reporting gaps in vaccination data, making it hard to compare consistently.

## Analysis: Vaccination Progress

Below is a bar chart **Comparing % of the Population Vaccinated**.

- We see that the Australia and Japan closely lead, followed by India.
- Congo lags significantly, which may be due to their lowest total cases and/or daily total cases.

### Vaccination Progress
We calculate and compare the percentage of the population vaccinated in each country.


### Conclusion
The data highlights the importance of vaccination in reducing fatalities. Different countries followed different trajectories depending on healthcare infrastructure and policy responses.
