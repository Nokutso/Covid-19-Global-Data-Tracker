## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

We examine **total cases**, **total deaths**, and **daily new cases** over time to observe major trends and spikes.

### 📈 Total Cases Over Time

The line chart shows the increase in COVID-19 cases over time:

- **India** experienced a sharp rise during mid-2021, likely due to the Delta variant.
- **USA** had multiple waves, with the highest spike in early 2022.
- **Japan** saw a sharp rise in early 2023.
- **Congo**, **Kenya**, and **Nigeria** showed a gradual increase with smaller peaks.

### 💀 Total Deaths Over Time

This chart shows total reported COVID-19 deaths:

- **USA** has the highest death count, reflecting both high case numbers and population size.
- **India** saw a steep incline in deaths during its case surge.
- **Congo** maintains a significantly lower death count.

### 📉 Daily New COVID-19 Cases

This chart shows daily new reported cases:

- **India** had major spikes during its second wave.
- **USA** shows frequent surges, reflecting pandemic waves.
- **Congo**, **Kenya**, and **Nigeria** experienced more stable daily cases.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. 🇮🇳 India has the highest total number of COVID-19 cases among the selected countries.  
2. 🇺🇸 The United States showed a sharp increase in new daily cases in late 2021.  
3. 🇨🇩 Congo had one of the slowest vaccine rollouts, with less than 20% vaccinated.  
4. There is a strong correlation between **population size** and **total cases**.  
5. Despite fewer cases, **Congo** had a relatively high **death rate** early in the pandemic.

## ❗ Anomalies or Interesting Patterns

- Some countries have gaps in **vaccination data reporting**, affecting consistency in comparisons.

---

## 💉 Vaccination Progress

A bar chart compares % of the population vaccinated:

- **Australia** and **Japan** lead, followed by **India**.
- **Congo** lags significantly, possibly due to lower case totals or limited reporting.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This analysis highlights the **importance of vaccination** in reducing fatalities. Each country’s trajectory was shaped by its **healthcare infrastructure**, **data availability**, and **policy responses**.
